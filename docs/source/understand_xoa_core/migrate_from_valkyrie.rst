Migrate from Xena Windows Desktop Test Suites
=============================================

We have developed a test configuration converter, `XOA Converter <https://docs.xenanetworks.com/projects/tdl-xoa-converter/>`_, to help users easily migrate their existing Windows test suite configurations ( `.x2544` for :term:`Xena2544`, `.x2889` for :term:`Xena2889`, `.x3918` for :term:`Xena3918`) into XOA. The illustration below may help you understand the use flow.
