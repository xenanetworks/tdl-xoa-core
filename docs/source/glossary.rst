    Test Resource
        Test chassis, test module, and test port, both hardware and virtual are referred to as test resources. A user must have the ownership of a test resource before be able to perform testing.

    API 
        Application Programming Interface.

    TGA
        Traffic Generation and Analysis.

    Resource Manager
        XOA Python API HL-API provides an easy way to manage subtester test resources, including obtaining test resources and managing indices. 
    
    Module Manager
        A Module Manager helps you access test modules. There is one Module Manager per tester.

    Port Manager
        A Port Managers helps you access test ports. There is one Port Manager per test module.

    Index Manager
        An Index Manager manages the subport-level resource indices such as stream indices, filter indices, connection group indices, match term indices, length term indices, etc. It automatically ensures correct and conflict-free index assignment.

    IDE
        An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development.

    XOA CLI
        Xena Command-Line Interface. Xena provides a rich set of CLI commands for users to administer test chassis for test automation.

    XOA Driver
        The foundation of Xena OpenAutomation is XOA Driver that provides Python interfaces for engineers to manage Xena test equipment.

    XOA Core
